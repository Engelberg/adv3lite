<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This is the first beta release version of adv3Lite. Please feel free to experiment with it, and by all means start writing a game in it, but do not rely on being able to release your adv3Lite game until a more stable version of the library is produced.</p>

<p>At this early stage we cannot guarantee that all features of the library will remain unchanged in future releases. As far as possible we'll try to ensure that everything described in this manual (with the exception of any features explicitly deprecated, such as remap) will continue to work as described, but we can't absolutely guarantee that nothing will change, since change may be unavoidable to implement some new feature or resolve some unanticipated difficulty. Any features of or code in the library not covered in this manual are liable to change without notice.</p>

<p>At the moment adv3Lite is a young project and I have no idea how many people will be interested in it. So if you have read this far, thank you for your interest! I hope that the adv3Lite library may be able to serve some of your IF needs either now or in the future.</p>
